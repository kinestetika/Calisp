## Calisp.py, version 3.1

Calisp.py (Calgary approach to isotopes in proteomics) is a program that estimates isotopic composition (e.g. 13C/12C,
delta13C, 15N/14N etc) of peptides from proteomics mass spectrometry data. Input data consist of mzML files and 
files with peptide spectrum matches.

Calisp was originally developed in Java. This newer, python version is much more concise, it consists of only six .py 
files, ~1,000 lines of code, compared to about fifty files and ~10,000 lines of code for the Java program. In addition,
the Java program depends on another program, mcl, whereas calisp.py is purely python, which is easy to install, see below.
The conciseness of the code makes the python version more transparent, easier to maintain and easier to further develop. 
I consider calisp.py the successor of the Java version. One of the reasons to shift to python is the possibility
to more effectively develop machine learning approaches to filter out noisy isotopic patterns. Future work will explore
that possibility.

Benchmarking of Calisp.py has been completed. It works well, benchmarking procedures and outcomes are shared in the 
"benchmarking" folder. Parsing of .mzid files still needs to be implemented but Thermo's spectrum protein match file format
 is supported.

Calisp.py depends on numpy, scipy, pandas, tqdm, [pymzml](https://pymzml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html), pyarrow. 
These will be installed automatically by the pip command below. 
Calisp outputs the data as a Pandas DataFrame saved in (binary) [feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) format.
Each row contains a single isotopic pattern, with column definitions listed below.
Calisp version 3.1 provides two small utility scripts to further process those data:

calisp_filter_patterns      filters out noisy patterns and converts the .feather file to a .csv file
calisp_compute_medians      reads the .csv file and outputs summary statistics for each protein or bin

See below for more details on these scripts. It is possible that you need more data wrangling than provided by the scripts.
In that case, you can for example explore and visualize the results in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To get
started you can explore the code of the two scripts as well as the two benchmarking notebooks, which are in the benchmarking folder.

Compared to previous versions of calisp, the workflow has been simplified. Calisp.py itself does not filter out any isotopic
patterns, or adds up isotopic patterns to reduce noise - like the Java version does. It simply estimates the ratio for 
the target isotopes (e.g. 13C/12C) for every isotopic pattern it can subsample. It estimates this ratio based on neutron 
abundance and using fast fourier transforms. The former applies to stable isotope probing experiments. The latter applies 
to natural abundances, or to isotope probing experiments with very little added label (e.g. using substrates with <1% 
additional 13C). The motivation for omitting filtering from the main calisp program is that keeping all subsampled isotopic
patterns, including bad ones, will enable training of machine learning classifiers. Also, because it was shown that the
median provides better estimates for species in microbial communities than the mean, adding up isotopic patterns to improve
precision has lost its purpose. There is more power (and sensitivity) in numbers.

Because no data are filtered out and no isotopic patterns get added up, calisp.py, analyzes at least ten times as many 
isotopic patterns compared to the Java version. That means calisp.py is about ten times slower, it takes about 5-10 min 
per .mzML file on a Desktop computer.

## Column names of the Pandas DataFrame created by calisp.py:

In the saved dataframe, each row contains one isotopic pattern, defined by the following columns:
```

                       file to consist of two parts, separated by a delimiter (_ by default). The 
                       first part is the bin/mag id, the second part the protein id

error_clumpy            the remaining error after fitting the pattern with the clumpy carbon 
                        method
flag_peptide_contains_sulfur true if peptide contains sulfur
flag_peptide_has_modifications true if peptide has no modifications
flag_peptide_assigned_to_multiple_bins true if peptide is associated with multiple proteins from 
                                       different bins/mags
flag_peptide_assigned_to_multiple_proteins true if peptide is associated with multiple proteins

c1 - c6                 contributions of clumps of 1-6 carbon to ratio_na. These are the 
                        outcomes of the clumpy carbon
                        model. These results are only meaningful if the biomass was labeled to 
                        saturation.
```
## Using a custom isotope abundance matrix

When estimating isotopic content for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur, the estimates will be strongly
affected by isotope abundances of carbon. For example, often biomass is slightly depleted in 13C compared to
the inorganic reference (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite). However, Calisp will assume the assumed 13C content to be
correct and will compensate the difference by reducing the content of the target isotope, which may result in
estimating a negative content for the target isotope (which is physically impossible). To overcome this issue,
you can provide a custom isotope matrix with the actual or estimated 13C content of your samples (or other changes
you may wish to make). The isotope matrix file should be formatted as follows, with elements on rows and isotopes
(+0, +1, +2, ... extra neutrons) on columns:

## calisp_filter_patterns

Use this script after running calisp to filter the detected patterns and to convert your data from binary .feather
format to a .csv file that can be imported into a spreadsheet program.

Example usage: calisp_filter_patterns --SIF --result_file [calisp result file or dir]

You need to specify --SIP or --SIF.

Arguments:
```
    --result_file       The .feather file generated by calisp, or a dir containing .feather files.
    --SIF               Apply benchmarked filters for stable isotope fingerprinting data.
    --SIP               Apply benchmarked filters for stable isotope probing data.
    --CRAP              Remove proteins in the CRAP database.
    --PROTEIN           If you plan to do a per-protein analysis, you may want to filter out patterns
                        assigned to more than one protein
    --flags             (Expert use:) Specify a custom list of flags for filtering patterns. Options:
                            flag_psm_has_low_confidence*
                            flag_psm_is_ambiguous*
                            flag_pattern_is_contaminated*$
                            flag_pattern_is_wobbly*
                            flag_peptide_assigned_to_multiple_proteins*
                            flag_peptide_assigned_to_multiple_bins*$
                            flag_peptide_mass_and_elements_undefined*$
                            flag_peptide_has_modifications
                            flag_peptide_contains_sulfur
                        Flags with * are default when using --SIP. Flags with $ are default when
                        using --SIF
    --max_fft_error     (Expert use:) Specify a custom maximum value for the allowable fft error.
                        This only makes sense for SIF data. The benchmarked default when using
                        --SIF is 0.001.
```

You need to specify --SIP or --SIF.

Arguments:
```
    --result_file               The .filtered.csv file generated by calisp_filter_patterns, or
                                a dir containing such files.

                                (only needed for delta calculations for SIF)
    --isotope_abundance_matrix  Path to file with isotope matrix, a default file is included with
                                calisp (only needed for delta calculations, SIF)
    --vocabulary_file           Use this if you want to replace bin names, protein names or
                                reassign patterns to bins or proteins (see below)
```

## The Vocabulary File

The file should consist of rows, with each row defining a change to the data. Each row should have four values, separated by
a single tab. The first and third values should be "bins", "proteins", "experiment" or "ms_run". here are a few examples:

### Example 1

In this example, changes are purely cosmetic, we replace abstract bin identifiers with a more meaningful taxonomy for
visualization:
```
bins	bin_245 bins	Prochlorococcus
...
```

### Example 2

In this example, we have two bins that are both Prochlorococcus. We are interested to plot the assimilation of 13C by
Prochlorococcus but we have two Prochlorococcus bins. Using the following vocabulary line, these two bins will both be
renamed to Prochlorococcus and will thus be treated as one:

```
bins	bin_245 bins	Prochlorococcus
bins	bin_395 bins	Prochlorococcus
```

### Example 3

We have a dataset, but never added any bin identifiers to protein ids. But we do want to compute median values by bin. We add a
line for each protein, assigning it to a bin:

```
proteins    Q72K23  bins    Azoarcus
proteins    Q72H45  bins    Azoarcus
proteins    Q72KG1  bins    Azoarcus
...
proteins    XD0001  bins    Nitrosomonas
proteins    XD0002  bins    Nitrosomonas
proteins    XD0003  bins    Nitrosomonas
...

### Example 4

We have analysed multiple replicates for each experiment and want to aggregate the results across the replicates:

```
ms_run  run_a1  ms_run  time_point_1
ms_run  run_a2  ms_run  time_point_1
...
ms_run  run_b1  ms_run  time_point_2
ms_run  run_b2  ms_run  time_point_2

```
